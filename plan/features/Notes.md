## Quick extra guidance

Keep TRANSFER distinct because transfers often require special handling (two accounts, not counted as expense+income).

INVESTMENT is useful if you track buys/sells separately from ordinary income/expense.

Use enum values in front-end TypeScript (generate types from Prisma) so the client and server share the same contract.
