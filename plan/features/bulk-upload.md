Plan new feature called bulk uploads. I want a page where user can bulk uoload the

- Category and sub category

## Category and sub-category

- User should able to upload category and sub category seperately with desired format
- Create excel file to upload in public folder with all req fields and 10 records for cateogry and sub-category
- Create seperate api for category and sub cateogry
- User first upload cateogry then using there ids user will upload sub-category
- Whiel uploading category user should provide color and icon
- Same while uploading sub-category user will provide categoryId and color, icon
- rewrite all cateogry and sub category api and functionality
- user only upload first time category and sub category using bulk upload if category already exist user only can edit or delete using funcionality
- If user want new category to add then he has to use the button add new category
- Create api to delete all category and sub category (use seperate buttons)

## Create api

- create api to upload bulk files for transactions and category, sub-category
- Make responsive design
- create seperate api for category and sub- category
- create api to delete all category and sub category create seperate buttons

## Note
